## Notes
### Unit testing
I tested 3 different files 
 - A page
 - A hook
 - A component

### API 
The api I used did not have a lot of info, like pictures :(
but I think it goes with the purpose of the test
For the suggestions input I use the same api to retrieving songs but was also to simulate a real suggestions api.
